# Cat-vs-Flower-Swin-Transformer
This project applies the SWIN Transformer for image classification to distinguish between two categories: Cats and Flowers. The model is fine-tuned to improve accuracy on this binary classification task, achieving significant results through gradual loss reduction and consistent test accuracy improvement.
