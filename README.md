# Cat-vs-Flower-Swin-Transformer
This project applies the SWIN Transformer for image classification to distinguish between two categories: Cats and Flowers. The model is fine-tuned to improve accuracy on this binary classification task, achieving significant results through gradual loss reduction and consistent test accuracy improvement. The cat and flower images were sourced from Kaggle and used to create a self-built dataset for this endeavor, ensuring a structured and customized approach to the classification task.
