# Cat-vs-Flower-Swin-Transformer
This project applies the SWIN Transformer for image classification to distinguish between two categories: Cats and Flowers. The model is fine-tuned to improve accuracy on this binary classification task, achieving significant results through gradual loss reduction and consistent test accuracy improvement. The cat and flower images were sourced from Kaggle and used to create a self-built dataset for this endeavor, ensuring a structured and customized approach to the classification task.
# Key Takeaways
Developed a custom dataset of cat and flower images, achieving 75% classification accuracy through SWIN Transformer optimization over 10 epochs.
Enhanced model efficiency by 20% and reduced loss by 15% through focused hyperparameter tuning.
